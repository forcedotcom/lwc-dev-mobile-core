 * TODO: Find a proper/permanent solution
 *
 * There seems to be a problem with accessing the IOS/Android config values from outside modules.
 * If module B has a dependency on lwc-dev-mobile-core, and if there is a module C that also has
 * a dependency on lwc-dev-mobile-core *and* a dependency on module B, then if module C calls into
 * module B and B calls into IOSConfig/AndroidConfig then module B gets garbled values.
 *
 * For example let Module A = lwc-dev-mobile-core and Module B = lwc-dev-mobile. Now if in a third
 * module A and B are both imported and then the Create Device command in module B is invoked, then
 * the Device Create command would try to access ios/android config values from module A and would
 * fail b/c it gets back garbled values.
 *
 * This only happens if the field in these config classes are defined as Static, or an instance
 * of these classes are cached. So for now as a workaround, we have the PlatformConfig class where
 * it instantiates a new instance of the config classes everytime they need to be accessed and this
 * ensures that both module A and B will always get the correct/non-garbled values. This is not an
 * ideal solution and is temporary until we can root cause the issue and find a better solution.
 *
 * NOTE: The same issue would occur if these classes were defined as JSON files and where imported
 * (i.e import iOSConfig from { IOSConfig.json } or similar for Android)
