 * TODO: Find a proper/permanent solution
 *
 * There seems to be a problem with accessing the IOS/Android config values from outside modules.
 * If module A has a dependency on our module, and if there is a module B that also has a dependency
 * on our module *and* a dependency on module A, then if module B calls into module A and A calls into
 * IOSConfig/AndroidConfig then module A gets garbled values.
 *
 * An example would be if module B called into Device Create command in module A at which point the
 * Device Create command would try to access ios/android config values and would fail b/c it gets back
 * garbled values.
 *
 * This only happens if the field in these config classes are defined as Static, or an instance
 * of these classes are cached. So for now as a workaround, we have the PlatformConfig class where
 * it instantiates a new instance of the config classes everytime they need to be accessed and this
 * ensures that both module A and B will always get the correct/non-garbled values. This is not an
 * ideal solution and is temporary until we can root cause the issue and find a better solution.
 *
 * NOTE: The same issue would occur if these classes were defined as JSON files and where imported
 * (i.e import iOSConfig from { IOSConfig.json } or similar for Android)
